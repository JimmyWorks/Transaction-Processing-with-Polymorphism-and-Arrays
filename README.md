# Transaction-Processing-with-Polymorphism-and-Arrays
[ 2/22/2017 ] Java program simulating how a company may handle transactions and customer database for a reward program.  Strictly using arrays and dynamically expanding and contracting, as needed, customer and preferred customer database files are uploaded to the program. The Customer class is used as objects to store customer ID numbers, first and last names, and total spending history.  The Preferred class is a derived class from Customer specifically for customers who have spent enough to be promoted to a reward member.  These members have access to special discount benefits depending on spending level.  Each transaction that comes in calculates the total transaction amount and is added to the total spending history for that customer.  Upon reaching reward member status, or upon reaching higher reward levels, the customer is removed from the Customer array and added to the Preferred array or his/her  reward/discount is increased, as needed.  Polymorphism is demonstrated, as needed, in the program. All global constants are labeled for easy reading and easy future updates.
